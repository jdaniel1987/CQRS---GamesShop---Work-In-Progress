# GamesShop

This project simulates a simple video game shop, with the main entities being Games and GamesConsoles. It is built following the principles of CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation), Clean Architecture, and DDD (Domain-Driven Design).

# Architecture and Design
- CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation): The project implements CQRS by using two different DbContexts pointing to the same SQL Server database. One of these DbContexts is configured for read-only purposes. This separation allows for optimized handling of read and write operations.  
- Clean Architecture: The project adheres to Clean Architecture principles, which helps in organizing the codebase into well-defined layers and ensuring that the core business logic is isolated from external concerns.  
- DDD (Domain-Driven Design): The project uses DDD concepts to model the business domain effectively, focusing on the main entities (Games and GamesConsoles) and their interactions.

# Scalability and Separation
- API Separation: The API is divided into commands and queries, allowing for independent scaling of read operations. This design facilitates scaling the read API separately if needed, improving performance and resource utilization.  

# The tech stack used to build source code is:  
- MediatR: Helps abstract the presentation layer from other layers.  
- Carter: Used to separate minimal API endpoints from the Program.cs file.  
- CSharpFunctionalExtensions: Adds the IResult object to abstract application layer handler responses from presentation layer responses.  
- FluentValidation: Provides easy-to-understand validators for command and query classes.  
- MediatR.Extensions.FluentValidation.AspNetCore: Enables automatic validation when commands and queries are sent to MediatR handlers.  
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore: ORM to facilitate database access.  

# The tech stack used to build unit and integration tests is:  
- FluentAssertions: Allows creating fluent and easy-to-understand assertions.  
- AutoFixture: Helps create objects automatically for use in tests.
- AutoFixture.AutomMoq: Creates mocks for interfaces automatically when used as test parameters.
- ILogger.Moq: Helps create and assert on logger mocks.
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory: Replaces SQL Server database with an in-memory one for testing purposes.
